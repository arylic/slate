KPW Notes - September 2021

'SlaveChannel' Command didn't work for me. Kind of Pointless command anyway

'SlaveMask' Command doesn't seem to have an effect for me

'SlaveMute' *// Note KPW - This Command didn't work for me with Slaves MINI & S50 of Master PRO.  I got the response "OK" but nothing happened on the devices. //* 

'setPlayerCmd:slave_vol' *// Note KPW - This command also works with Host Device !! So it is identical to 'setPlayerCmd:vol'

Command: `getFileInfo` Note KPW  `totlen=00:00:00` Total Length is always 0
