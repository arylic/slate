# Multiroom / Multizone

Multiroom is a very special feature in LinkPlay modules. Several devices can be grouped together to form a so-called listening zone, so that all devices in this group play music from one and the same source. The volume can be controlled per device or for the entire group.

If you have already grouped several devices into one zone, then one device of this group is always the host. All other devices are child to this one. This is important to know if you want to play music via Spotify Connect. In the Spotify app, only the host appears in the list of Connect devices! All other devices are hidden.
