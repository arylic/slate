# TCP API

Welcome to Arylic's TCP API developer documentation.  
This documentation describes the API of DIY audio boards, which are manufactured by the [Linkplay](https://linkplay.com/) company. Their boards are so called white label solutions, which means that hundreds of brands use them in their own products (as Arylic does). There are many well-known manufacturers that use Linkplay as their core. Theoretically, most of them should be controllable with the API described below.
