## Track Info from USB stick/disk

Allows to query file information on a connected USB stick or hard drive. Two parameters are passed. The first, the  `index` value, stands for "the number of files in the file system" from which the output should start. The second parameter `range` specifies how many files should be analyzed, starting with `index`. So, if `range` is larger than `1`, the response will give informations for multiple music files.

Command: `getFileInfo`
